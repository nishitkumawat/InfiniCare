Reve Sponsored Track: Algorithm Development Hackathon
Introduction
Reve is pleased to sponsor a special track at the Nirma University Hackathon, dedicated to
fostering innovation and excellence among students in software algorithm development.
This exciting competition invites talented young minds to apply their skills to address
significant real-world challenges in two critical domains: Digital Healthcare and Digital
Farming. Participants will have access to specialized data sets and sensor information
provided by Reve, enabling them to craft innovative, impactful solutions.
Challenge Domains:
1. Digital Healthcare
• Participants will develop algorithms focused on early and accurate detection of
various cancers, including breast cancer, throat cancer, and skin cancer, leveraging
data from Reve’s advanced optical spectrometer and digital imaging technologies.
• Objectives:
• Analyze optical spectrometer data and high-resolution digital images.
• Build algorithms capable of identifying biomarkers and spectral signatures indicative
of cancer.
• Enhance the accuracy, reliability, and speed of non-invasive cancer diagnostics.
Data Provided:
• Optical Spectrometer data (spectral reflectance and absorption data).
• Digital Camera images (high-resolution clinical-grade images).
2. Digital Farming
Participants will create intelligent algorithms aimed at improving soil health assessment and
crop management, using Reve’s Spectrometer data combined with multi-parameter soil
sensor data and capacitive moisture sensing technologies.

Objectives:
• Develop algorithms to interpret complex spectroscopic soil data.
• Identify and predict soil health indicators, including moisture content, nutrient levels,
organic matter, and overall fertility.
• Provide actionable insights for farmers to improve crop yields, sustainability, and
productivity.

Data Provided:
• Reve Spectrometer soil spectral data.
• Multi-parameter soil sensor data (moisture, pH, nutrients, salinity, temperature,
conductivity, and organic content).
• Capacitive soil moisture sensor data for precise moisture profiling.
Evaluation Criteria
Participants' submissions will be evaluated based on:
• Accuracy and reliability of the developed algorithms.
• Innovation and originality in approach.
• Practical applicability and potential impact of solutions.
• Efficiency and scalability of algorithms.
• Presentation and clarity of documented solutions.
Rewards
Outstanding solutions will be recognized with:
a. Internship at Reve AI Private Limited.
b. Job opportunities in the field of Digital healthcare, Digital farming, Nano sciences,
Quantum sciences etc in advancing critical fields.
Conclusion
We at Reve encourage students to bring forward their best ideas and technical expertise to
develop groundbreaking solutions in Digital Healthcare and Digital Farming. Your creativity
and innovation have the power to significantly contribute to societal well-being and
sustainable development.
